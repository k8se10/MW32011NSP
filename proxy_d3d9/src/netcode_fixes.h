// module's .cpp file compile unmodified into BOTH NSP's own standalone proxy DLL
// (this build) and a future MW32011NCP-plugin build (tools/ncp_plugin_netcode_fixes/,
// a separate task) -- the standalone dllmain.cpp populates FixHostServices with thin
// wrappers around raw MinHook/GetModuleHandleA; the NCP plugin populates it directly
// from the MW3NCP_PluginAPI* the host hands it (the shapes already match closely by
// design). Neither target's fix-module .cpp files should ever call MinHook or
// GetModuleHandle directly -- always go through this struct.

// the shared copy-primitive hook used for findings 2/3 can't recover the real
// buffer's bounds from that address alone, and a full-function replacement risks
// missing undocumented behavior in the function's own "magic-byte-range/version-
// compat checks" section this project doesn't yet fully understand). Real next step,
// not attempted here rather than shipping an unverified guess.
